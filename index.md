# Changes 
##### I created a new pull request to edit the index file with headers. Then I added an image of Yogitocat, with alt-text (so the text is read aloud for people using screen readers and for when the image won't display). Then I added a Markdown for a code example. Then I added a task list that checks the things I have done during this course.
